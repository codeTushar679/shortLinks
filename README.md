I made full stack Link Shortener with help of Next js with Mongo Atlas DB.

In this project have some small features like :
You can customize your own link or you can ignore customize input to generate a random link.
You can not use same customize name in customize input again after generated, if you try then it shows alert.
These all links are going to save in my Mongo Atlas DataBase.
And a button to copy the result.
So, enjoy this mini project and have a nice day!
